# Instructions

This repository contains a single function that can be sourced in your R 
environment. The function extract digital values from a single or multi layer 
raster file (e.g. geotiff) and produces a data frame containing a class column 
(Class: Factor) and one or multiple predictor columns (Band1: num, 
Band2: num, ...), depending on the number of layers that the raster file contains.
The final dataframe can be used for subsequent statistical analysis in R, such 
as land cover classification.

# How to use

```
install.packages(c("raster"))

source("FUN_extract_polyclass.R")

  img <- brick("data/rasterfile")
  shp <- shapefile("data/shapefile.shp")

testdf <- extract_polyclass(shp, img)
```
# Thank you

If you find the function useful, please give it a "Star" and tell others. Let me
know if there is room for improvement (there always is). Cheers, RenÃ©
